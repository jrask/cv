## Summary

I am a senior developer and architect with experiences from many business areas. I have many years of professional development with a background in Java backend development. In the last 8 years, I have shifted my focus to also include cloud architecture, big-data & devops. I have several years of daily work with Amazon Web Services with focus on infrastructure as code.

I enjoy projects where I can be involved on the complete software lifecycle (code-run-observe) with "true" devops mindset, "we build it - we run it".
